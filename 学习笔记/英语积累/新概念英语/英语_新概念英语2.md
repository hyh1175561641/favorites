# Lesson 1 A private conversation

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end, I could not bear it. I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.
"It's none of your business, " the young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation!"

**Key words and expressions**

- angry a.愤怒的 angrily adv.愤怒地

**Questions on the text**

1. Where did the writer go last week? He went to the theatre.
2. Why didn't he enjoy the play? Because he could not hear the actors, a young man and a young woman behind him were talking loudly.
3. What did the young man say to the writer?  He said,"It's none of your business, it's a private conversation!"

**Language points**

- Last week I <u>went to the theatre</u>.这里需要用定冠词the，表示去某一场所的特定活动 =>go to the cinema / show / bank / post office
- I did not <u>enjoy</u> it (the play). it指the play, enjoy是英语中常用的动词=>I did not enjoy the meal / book.
- I <u>got</u> very angry. got是变的怎么样，在语法上相当于be动词的功能，是一个连系动词 =>The food is getting cold. 
- I could not <u>hear the actors</u>. 听见某人说什么话，hear sb.hear是听见，如果强调听这个行为的本身用listening=>Do you hear me? He's not listening to me.
- I <u>looked at</u> the young man and the young woman angrily. look at 意思是看谁，强调的是看这个动作，see意思是看见，观看用watch =>Did you see Sam yesterday? She's watching TV.
- They did not pay any attention (to me). pay attention后加宾语用介词to =>Please pay attention to that picture on the wall.
- In the end, I could not bear it. bear是忍受，容忍的意思 =>in the end = at last. bear<==>stand

# Lesson 2 Breakfast or lunch?

It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sunday. I sometimes stay in bed until lunchtime. Last Sunday I got up very late. I looked out of the window. It was dark outside. "What a day!" I thought. "It's raining again." Just then, the telephone rang. It was my aunt Lucy. "I've just arrived by train," she said. "I'm coming to see you."
"But I'm still having breakfast," I said.
"What are you doing?" she asked.
"I'm having breakfask," I repeated.
"Dear me," she said."Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock!"



# Lesson 3 Please send me a card

Postcards always spoil my holidays. Last summer, I went to Italy. I visited museums and sat in public gardens. A friendly waiter taught me  a few words of Italian. Then he lent me a book. I read a few lines, but I did not understand a word. Every day I thought about postcards. My holidays passed quickly, but I did not send cards to my friends. On the last day I made a big decision. I got up early and bought thirty-seven cards. I spent the whole day in my room, but I did not write a single card!



# Lesson 4 An exciting trip

I have just received a letter from my brother, Tim. He is in Australia. He has been there for six months. Tim is an engineer. He is working for a big firm and he has already visited a great number of different places in Australia. He has just bought an Australian car and has gone to Alice Springs, a small town in the **centre** of Australia. He will soon visit Darwin. From there, he will fly to Perth. My brother has never been abroad before, so he is finding this trip very exciting. 



- a difference between *centre* and *center*



# Lesson 5 No wrong numbers

Mr. James Scott has a garage in Silbury and now he has just bought another garage in Pinhurst. Pinhurst is only five miles from Silbury, but Mr. Scott cannot get a telephone for his new garage, so he has just bought twelve pigeons. Yesterday, a pigeon carried the first message from Pinhurst to Silbury. The bird covered the distance in three minutes. Up to now, Mr. Scott has sent a great many requests for spare parts and other urgent messages from one garage to the other. In this way, he has begun his own private "telephone" service.



# Lesson 6 Percy Buttons

I have just moved to a house in Bridge Street. Yesterday a beggar knocked at my door. He asked me for a meal and a glass of songs. I gave him a meal. He ate the food and drank the beer. Then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighbour told me about him. Everybody knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He calls at every house in the street once a month and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.
